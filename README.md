# REAL-TIME-FACEMASK

##Face Detection using Open CV and Haar Cascades

This requires ***Open CV, Python, Haar Cascades training data and suitable OS platform (Mac, Linux or Windows)***. 
For specific version please check vendor websites for the latest.

I used Python 3.9.4 on a test machine running Windows 10
